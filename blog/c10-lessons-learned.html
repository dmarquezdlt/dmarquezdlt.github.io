        <p> Phase 1 at DevBootcamp finally arrived; Week 1 passed faster than you can say "recursion". The warnings of 12 hour days and coding nightmares are true. You will be in a the 6th floor of a building, coding with the same ~30 people for 12 hours, and when you go home for some sleep, you'll dream of how to fix the code you couldn't figure out a few hours ago.
        </p>
        <p> Now that the week is done and my first assessment passed, I've had time to sleep, decompress and summarize what kernels of knowledge were given to me last week. While I could make a long list of the technical terms and methods I learned, the most important things I learned this week were the cultural components of DBC, and the tech world in general.

          <li> <b>Pseudocode:</b> before you write any code, define your problem. You should know what the INPUT and OUTPUT of every piece of code is, as well as every step in between. You should write all this down in plain english, (NO technical terms), and have this pseudocode available readily to refer to when you get bogged down in the minutiae of the code.</li>
          <li> <b>Name your variables carefully:</b> get yourself out of the habit of using generic variable names. "x", "element", "i" mean nothing. Your variable names should tell you exactly what the variable holds. "list_of_scores", "row_length", and "employee_first_names" are much clearer. </li>
          <li> <b>Test everything</b> explain </li>
          <li> <b>There's more than 1 way to skin a cat</b> explain </li>
          <li> <b>Write code for people, not computers</b> explain </li>
          <li> <b>Expose your ignorance</b> explain </li>
          <li> <b>Don't compare yourself</b> explain </li>
