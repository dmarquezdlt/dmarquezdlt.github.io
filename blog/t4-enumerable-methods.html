      <h1>Enumerable#Map</h1>
      <h2>Ruby's way of changing collections</h2>
      <h4>14.12.2014</h4>
      <section>
        <p>First off, <code>Enumerable</code> is module in Ruby that works for collections of things. That mean you cannot apply any of its methods to single things, (like a string, or a number). You use enumerable methods to collections of data, like hashes or arrays.</p>
        <p>There is a long list of <code>Enumerable</code> methods, such as: each, drop, find, grep, and reject. Today, however, I want to focus on <code> map</code>, as I conside it to be one of the most important and basic enumerable methods.</p>
        <p>Map Basics
          <ol>
            <li>Map loops through an objects elements and applies a change, specified by a block of code. </li>
            <li>Map will always return an array.</li>
            <li>Map will return in the original length.</li>
          </ol>
          </p>
        <p>For example, let us pretend you are sending out a bunch of emails to the parents of your failing students to warn them that their children are not doing well. You have a list, (in an array of course, of all the students last names. <br><br>
          <code>
            >> failing_names = ["johnson", "SMITH", "Rodriguez", "LEE", "Bell", "lopez", "kim"]</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are auto inserting their last names into an email, you'll be looking unprofessional if you insert the names as they are: some in all caps or all lowercase. For this, you can use the enumerable method <code>map</code> to loop thorugh them and make them all one format.
            Simple use the <code>capitalize</code> method on each name.
            <br><br>
            <code>
              >> failing_names.map {|last_name| last_name.capitalize} <br>
              => ["Johnson", "Smith", "Rodriguez", "Lee", "Bell", "Lopez", "Kim"]
            </code>
            <br>
            <br>
            Ta-da! Your names are all in proper format. So what did you do? You called map on the array (<code>failing_names.map</code>). In the block following, (everything inside the {}), you asked the code to takee each item in the array, (<code>last_name</code>), and capitalize it. Since <code>map</code> always returns an array, you now have a new array with each last name capilatized!
          </p>
        <p>NOTE: In order to permanently save these changes you must use the desturctive <code>map!</code> method or push the results into a new array. Otherwise, next time you call the array, it will go back to the original, unformatted version.</p>
