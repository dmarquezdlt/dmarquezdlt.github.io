        <p>I don't deal well with conflict. If I feel conflict arising, I am quick to flee. I am not proud to admit that at times, rather than confront a problem with someone, I will cut them out of my life JUST to avoid having to deal with a problem. Unfortunately for me, you can't always do that. There are people like co-workers, classmates, roomates, and family that you can't completely avoid.
        </p>
        <p> I was once a situation where I didn't know my new roomate very well. We didn't see each other much and I tried to stay out of her way. When we ran into each other in the kitchen or the living room, conversation was awkward. We had a set list of chores to complete every weekend. Which, I thought was a great idea. However, when we established who would do what chores which weekend, we never talked about what time they had to get done. Being the procrastinator I am, I never even attempted to do my chores on Saturday...I could wait until Sunday (still the weekend, right?). </p>
        <p>For a few Saturdays, as I was running out the door with friends, my roomate would remind me that I still hadn't done my chores. And I was so annoyed with her everytime. The next day, I would get my chores done. </p>
        <p> One Sunday morning, I woke up and discovered all my chores had been done. Awesome! Same thing the next weekend. Turns out my roomate had gotten so irritated that I didn't complete my chores promptly that she just started doing them herself...and also reported me to our housing authorities. Oh, man. We had to have meetings and talks and ay, ay, ay. </p>
        <p> Looking back, I knew she was irritated when she started doing my chores. But really, I knew she was irritated when she kept reminding me about my chores every Saturday morning. I didn't react, however, because I was so annoyed at her reminding me. It was like she thought I was not responsible to do things on my own, and I felt like she was trying to create her own authority over me, when in fact we had not arranged a set time to have chores completed by. It all seems silly now. We could have easily avoided it if she had suggested we set a time that everything be done by. Or if I had spoken up and said, "I thought we had all weekend?". Or if she hadn't been more lenient on when stuff was done. Or if I had just sucked it up and did everything on Saturday. Anyways, none of those "or if" statements happened, so a simple problem rolled out of control.</p>
        <p>Going back, I would have just added a deadline to our list of chores and all would be good. We may have even gotten along as roomates!</p>
        <p> What I learned was that communication helps more than you think, and avoiding problems doesn't mean they're solved. Setting clear expectations, is clutch to interactions with people you don't know very well.</p>
