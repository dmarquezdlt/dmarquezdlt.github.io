Give me ALL THE VERSION CONTROLL

The best way to orgranize and track everything ever

Version Control is awesome. Once you learn about git's version control you will wish you could apply version control to all aspects of your life, (hence my title).
Imagine that you are dating someone. First date is great. You approve. Second date is awesome. You approve. Thrid date is still going well. You approve. Then, suddenly, on the fourth date, you have the worst time of your life.
Wouldn't it be nice to pause, take a look at everything that went wrong, study what different scenarios you could have taken to have a better date, then simply decide to go back to the third date and pretend the fourth date never happened?
With version control, you can! Version control let's you work on a project and store changes you make at every stage. Whenever you store the changes, there is a log that keeps track of what changed, who changed it, and when they changed it. You can continually update your project. Whenever anything goes wrong, or you decide to take a different direction with your project, you can just select a previous version you had saved and start working from there.
