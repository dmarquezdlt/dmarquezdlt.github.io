      <section>
        <p>Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas are a type of code that act upon an object in Ruby.</p>
        <p><b>Blocks</b> are very general. You can call a block of code on an object. Blocks are usually recongnizable by their <code>do...end</code> syntax or <code> {...} </code>. That means that anything within that structure will be ran to the object it is called upon.
        For example, let's take an array of numbers, <code>[3,10,5,6,8]</code> and call the <code>each</code> method to it so it will run our block of code on each element of the array. </p><br>
        <code>[3,10,5,6,8].each do<br>
        <tab>#code goes here<br>
          end</code>
          <br>
        <p>So now, we have created the skeleton for whatever code we want to run on each number in the array. The <code>block</code> part is whatever we put inside the <code>do</code> and <code>end</code>. Let's square each number!</p>
        <br>
        <code>[3,10,5,6,8].each do |x|<br>
         puts x*2<br>
          end</code>
          <br>
        <p>The result for this will be:</p>
        <br>
        <code>
          9<br>
          100<br>
          25<br>
          36<br>
          64<br>
        </code>
          <br>
          <p> The block literally took the square of each number and put it on a line.</p>
          <p><b>Procs</b> is short for procedure! With <code>Proc</code> you can set a block of code to a variable and reuse that block of code whenever you want. <code>Proc</code> is a class, so to create a new instance of <code>Proc</code>, you call it with typical class notation</p>
          <p><code>variable_name = Proc.new{#code goes here}</code></p>
          <p>Now, we can put whatever block of code we want to repeat inside the brackets and then apply that code to objects. Let's make a block of code that prints everything out with a smiley face at the end.</p>
          <p> <code>
            smiles = Proc.new {|x| puts "-" + x + ":)" }
          </code></p>
          <p>We've names the block of code <code>smiles</code>. Now we can simply use that name in place of the block of code. There are a <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Proc.html">few different ways</a> to use Proc and call the new procedures, but for this case, we will call it an an array. NOTE: place a & before the Proc name to call the block.</p>
          <p><code>
            words = ["I'm","walking","on","sunshine"]<br>
            words.each(&smiles)</code></p>
            The result?<br><br>
            <code>
            -I'm :) <br>
            -walking :) <br>
            -on :) <br>
            -sunshine :) <br>
            </code>
          <p>Now we've packaged that block and can use it over and over by using &smiley!</p>
          <p>Finally, <b>Lambda</b> is a very specific type of Proc. They basically do the same thing, but lambdas are picky about the # of arguements passed to it and lambda gives more control the calling method than proc. You don't need <code>.new</code> to create a lambda. Let's create a lambda that converts numbers to strings.
            <p><code>
            numbers = [1,4,5,7,9]<br>
            conversion = lambda { |x| x.to_s}<br>
            numbers.collect!(&conversion)<br>
            >>["1", "4", "5", "7", "9"]<br>
          </code></p>
          <p>This returned a new array with the numbers as strings. Notice we use the same & symbol to call lambdas as we do to call procs.
          <p>
          </p>




          </code></p>
