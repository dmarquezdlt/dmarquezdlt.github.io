        <p>When learning something new, like, let's say, coding, there are many things you don't know right away. (Obviously). And the best way to learn is to ask questions. However, not all questions are equal. For example, if you ask "What's the best language to learn?", you will get many responses. But there's no definite answer on "best", so you won't get a clear answer, because you asked a broad question.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you change your question to "What are the positive and negatives of learning Java vs Ruby?", you might get less responses but the answers you get will give a clearer picture.
        </p>
        <p> When I have a question, I usually don't post it anywhere to get an answer, instead, I search for someone else who's already asked a similar question before, and try to use their answer to my benefit.
        Google is my tool of choice for answering coding questions. For example, if I'm trying to use a ternary expression with my ruby script, but I keep getting an error, I usually take 1 of two approaches:</p>
        <ol><li>I trust the answers given on Stack Overflow, so I search "stackoverflow ruby ternary syntax", or</li>
        <li>I search "what is the proper syntax for ruby ternary"</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      The first query will likely provide me many links to answered questions on Stackoverflow.com dealing with ternary in Ruby. That's great, because I can look over the many examples of syntax and compare that to my code. Eventually, you will see what looks different. I like this method because, although it's a little harder, it makes you learn from your mistakes. <br>The second method will give you a list of links to articles and posts about teranry syntax. It will be a lot more informative and you will see why things work a certain way and how you should word your code. This method is super informative. My problem with it, however, it the examples given on these posts are very elemetary, so if the problem you are having is complex, you might understand what you are supposed to do, but there won't be a example showing you the actual code.</p>
