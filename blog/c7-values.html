       <p>At DBC, we were asked what values come to mind when you think about the happiest, proudest, and most satisfying moments of your life. After some reminiscing, I found a common theme in those life moments: Accomplishment, Competition, Helping the community, Self-Reliance, and Knowledge. In all postitive moments in my life, there have been a combination of these 5 values that make those moments stand out as special. </p>
       <p> Of course, not all values and moments were equal. Some of those only arise in professinal moments, some only in personal life accomplishments. So I am more commited to a few of these values than others. If I ranked these values from most important in general to my life and then assigned each a value from 1(not very much) - 5(very much) of how much I try to uphold these values in my life, it would look something like this:
       </p>
       <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Helping others: 3</li>
          <li>Accomplishment: 3</li>
          <li>Competition: 3</li>
          <li>Knowledge: 4</li>
          <li>Self-Reliance: 4</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>I have a harder time living up to some values, even though they are important to me and all my actions. However, I think that by far my underlying value in almost everthing I do, both professionaly and personally, is helping others. Even as I child, I wanted to help everyone: other kids, animals, people in otehr countries, my parents, etc. If there was a person or there was a cause, I was down to do my part. As I've grown older, it has become a value I try to live by because I think helping others comes from a place of empathy, which can solve many, many problems. There is an underlying hope that helping others will cause others to help others also, (a little pay it forward action). I can't claim that it a completely altruistic value, there is a very satisfying sense of accomplishment when you help someone.</p>
      <p>My chosen value comes up when I try to give advice. The last person to ask for advice was my cousin. She was having problems in school with motivation and being one of the only girls in her engineering program. My initial reaction was to tell her to suck it up and put in work, and she'd be happy later. But I figured that telling her that wouldn't really ease her mind. She needed to find her own motivation. So intead, my advice for her was to try to remember why she had started in the first place and to map out what she wanted to do in the future.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking back about last week's topic on stereotype threat, I feel that the best strategy to attack my stereotype threat and prevent repeating what happened in college is to stick o my values. If I can commit to living up to the values that are important to me, stereotype threat would not be a threat at all. The reason for me being in this program is to start working in EdTech and help reform the education system. I am driven to succeed in this program to be able to help more youth have access to quality education. If I stick to my competition value, I can turn any threat I start to feel into a competition and a challenge I need to surpass. My knowledge value will be a constant reminder that no matter what a difficul time I may be having, I am learning and accumulating knowledge to better myself and help others. So I think I waill follow my own advice, and prepare a letter to myself about why I am doing this program and what the outcome I want is. Then, whenever I am feeling unaccomplished and that I have bitten off more than I can chew, I can recenter on my values and focus on sucking it up and putting in work.
