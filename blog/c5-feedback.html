      <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>

        <p>I've always been one to prefer working alone. I understand how my mind works and can navigate problems my way at my own pace. At DBC, we pair with other cohort mates every week to work on challenges. And a challenge it has been, indeed.</p>
        <p>Pairing pushed my comfort level because I have to share my thinking process with someone and try to take them along for the ride with me. At first, it bothered me, because it interupts my working cycle. If I think of something, I want to try it. With pairing, I have to explain what I am doing and direct someone else to do it, or, (if I'm driving) I have to solve the problem someone else's way, under their direction, rather than do what I think would work. It can be a rather frustrating process. This was especially true in the first few weeks, where the challenges were rather simple and pairing only made them twice as hard. </p>
        <p>However, as the challenges got harder, I was glad to have a second set of knowledge to solve problems. I have learned a lot technically from my pairing partners, but I have also learned about communication. The more I pair, the easier it is for me to explain what I am thinking and how I intend to solve the problem. Sessions are less frustrating now that the first week. </p>
        <p>My favorite part of pairing is when a partner and I solve a part of a challenge we kept getting wrong. After 20 minutes of trial and error, discussion, and attempting some ridiculous combinations to try to fix a bug, there is nothing better than your RSPEC running with zero failures! It is twice as sweet to be able to accomplish and celebrate that moment with someone. TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK! :)</p>
        <p>The second part of pairing is feedback. I've always enjoyed getting constructive criticism, so receiving feedback hasn't been difficult. I know I am new at coding and have a lot to work on. It's nice to have people point out where I can start working on things. The feedback I have received is pretty consistent, I should work on giving more detailed instructions when I am navigating. Of course, it's also nice to hear the good things your partners have to say about you. </p>
        <p>Giving feedback is a little harder for me. There are times when I am so focused on solving the problem and I work so well with my partner, that I forget to think of things to ask them to work on. Other times, I get so frustrated working with someone that it is hard to tell them what they are doing well.</p>
        <p>The whole paring and feedback loop has shown me I lack a lot in the communication department. Whether it's when I am directing someone or when giving feedback. I think the loop is a great way to learn. Pairing forces you to explain what you already know, reinforcing your knowlege and it let's you learn from other people. Feedback lets you reflect on what you can work on. Although it still makes me uncomfortable, I can think of many other situations and jobs, where this loop would be helpful.</p>
