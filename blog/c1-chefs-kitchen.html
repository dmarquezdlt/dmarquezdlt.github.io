      <h3>DBC: Expecting the worst</h3>
      <h4>21.11.2014</h4>
      <section>
        <p>I have a confession. I had previously started Phase 0 but had to defer my start date because of work. I finished the first 5 weeks. Despite my early preview into DBC, my views remain the same. In fact, they have been reinforced.</p>
        <p>I'm expecting the worst going into DBC--to work long hours, to not understand everything, and even to not get along with everyone. But I also think it will be one of the best growth and learning experience I will ever have. I think I will like the complete immersion environment and the high expetations. Shereef's video definitely addressed some of my concerns.</p>
        <p>After my first intro session, I called my best friend to tell her how worried I was that I might not be able to do the program and that there had been a mistake in my acceptance because I know so little and was already having bumps in the road on week 1. Going in this second time, I am a little more confident, but my worries are still there. It's good to know that I am not the only person that has felt like that going into this program. I am excited to start and to use my nervousness as a motivator to push myself to do better.</p>
