      <h3>Version Control: The best way to orgranize and track everything ever</h3>
      <h4>21.11.2014</h4>
      <section>
        <p>Version Control is awesome. Once you learn about git's version control you will wish you could apply version control to all aspects of your life, (hence my title).</p>
        <p>Imagine that you are dating someone. First date is great. You approve. Second date is awesome. You approve. Third date is still going well. You approve. Then, suddenly, on the fourth date, you have the worst time of your life. Wouldn't it be nice to pause, take a look at everything that went wrong, study what different scenarios you could have taken to have a better date, then simply decide to go back to the third date and pretend the fourth date never happened?</p>
        <p>With version control, you can! Version control let's you work on a project and store changes you make at every stage. Whenever you store the changes, there is a log that keeps track of what changed, who changed it, and when they changed it. You can continually update your project. Whenever anything goes wrong, or you decide to take a different direction with your project, you can just select a previous point on the log where you were still happy with your project and start from there.</p>
        <p>Version control is present in many programs (like Review in Word, or even just the undo button). Git, however, makes it very easy for programmers to work on bits of code and "commit it", (aka save it), along the way. It provides insurance for every step you take. You can jump from your current version to a previous version to review changes and decide which one you prefer before moving on to next steps. You can also create a branch so you have a copy of your code to play with, while your original stays the same. Afterwards, you can decide if you want to merge them, or only keep one version.</p>
        <p>GitHub, (not to be confused with git) is a website that works with git to not only let you store all these different versions in a userfriendly matter, but also share with others to collaborate. This way, many programmers can work on one project, but you have the insurance git provides that no one will be able to completely fuck up your code. You can always just go to the previous version.</p>
