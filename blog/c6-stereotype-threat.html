      <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <h2>Being a woman of color in tech</h2>
      <h4>11.01.2015</h4>

        <p>Stereotype threat is the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group. It is the feeling I get when I work with a large group of men and I am the only woman: These men are waiting for me to say something stupid. If I talk, I risk saying something that could prove them right. If I stay quiet, all they can do is suspect I am stupid, but they can never prove it. So, I should stay quiet. </p>
        <p> I've been lucky to be have been a stubborn young child that liked to prove people wrong. If someone thought I couldn't do something, I'd do it. If someone expected me to be one way, I was another. So up until the end of high school, typical stereotypes of being a woman and Latina didn't bother me. Instead, I did my best to prove people wrong by being the brightest in my class in science and math.</p>
        <p>Then came Stanford. And new stereotypes hit that I hadn't dealt with before, since so many of my old classmates came from the similar backgrounds. At Stanford, I realizes there were stereotypes that came from being poor, from the country, and from uneducated parents. I had never felt more defeated. I registered for a mid-level math class. I could take it, right? I was so wrong. I was surrounded my people who were so much more prepared than me. Instead of risking failing, I dropped the class and registered for the easiest math class I could find. And I passed it without any issues.</p>
        <p> I gravitated towards classes with people who were familiar and in subjects I knew I could dominate because I didn't want to risk showing my ignorance. When I was required to take "techy" classes (math, science, etc), I chose the easiest class and didn't try, that way I would slide by, but I always had the excuse that I wasn't even trying.</p>
        <p>It worked. I mean, I graduated from Stanford. But had I not been scared of what people thought of me or think that showing I wasn't the best at something would somehow prove that it was because of my background, I could have done so much better. I would definitely have been in Computer Science much earlier. I took the beginner courses and liked them. But soon changed my mind when I started telling people I was interested and they laughed or said, "Just wait until it gets harder." The stereotype threat killed the fighting spirit I had as a child. </p>
        <p> I had a huge "Aha" moment when I learned about stereotype threat. I recognized all the emotions I had felt, the reasons, the embarassment, the lack of motivation. And I felt stupid. Had I recognized it while I was still in college I would have taken on so many more challenges. Doing DevBootcamp is part of embracing this challenge. I know I'm smart enough and want to prove those people who doubted me when I took an interest in CS. But I still have moments when I wonder if this program is something I can complete and this industry is somewhere I can be competent. I really think I can, but if it were so easy, why are there so little minorities in tech? Why are there so few women in tech? Why is there so much media attention about what a bad place tech is for women? Can I really deal with this? Am I making a huge mistake? In public, I am good at pretending I'm not swaeting it, but I'm worried as fuck. However, I think reading about stereotype threat and knowing how crushing it can be is motivation enough for the moment. I realize that as a woman, I am expected to work in the marketing and sales side of tech, not coding. I realize that as a person of color, I am not really expected to be in tech. I plan to embrace those stereotypes and prove they are incorrect.</p>
