    <summary> My reflections on the Fireside Chat with Shereef

        <h4><!--section title--></h4>
        I'm expecting the worst going into DBC--to work long hours, to not underrstand many things, and even to not get along with everyone. 
        But I also think it will be one of the best growth and learning experience I will ever have. 
        I think I will like the complete immersion environment and the high expetations.
        Shereef's video definitely addressed some of my concerns. After my intro session, I called my best friend to tell her how worried I was that I might not be able to do the program and that there had been a mistake in my acceptance because I know so little and was already having bumps in the road on week 1.
        It's good to know that I am not the only person that has felt like that going into this program. I am still very worried, but I'm also hopeful and excited to start the journey.
