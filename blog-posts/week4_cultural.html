    <h3>Minorites in tech</h3>
    <summary>...or rather, a lack of them. That's the topic I'll be addressing for week 4 of Dev Bootcamp.</summary>
    <p>If you look at the tech crowd as a whole, you will find a largely homogeneous looking group: Young, white males.
      And if you think I'm exaggertating go look at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/google-admits-it-hires-too-many-white-dudes/">Google Admitting It Hires Too Many White Dudes.</a> And Google isn't the only one. <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/07/23/twitter-diversity-statistics/">Twitter</a>, <a href="">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/diversity-stats-10-tech-companies-that-have-come-clean/">LinkedIn</a>, and many other tech companies mirror these demographics.
      <br><center><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/06/27/tech_diversity_data_facebook_follows_google_yahoo_in_releasing_the_stats.html" ><img src="../imgs/techstats.jpg"/></a></center><br> We see the same lack of diversity in tech workers as we do in tech entrepreneurship and tech leadership. Only 4% of tech-based enterprises are minority-owned.
      <br>This lack of diversity is problem on many levels: on the scope of products produced; on the economic disparities created around technology-centered areas (rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in SF is now <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2014/08/13/san-francisco-rent-explosion-median-rent-two-bedroom-apartment-tops-4k">~$4000/month</a>, largely due to <a href="http://truth-out.org/news/item/23305-the-bleaching-of-san-francisco-extreme-gentrification-and-suburbanized-poverty-in-the-bay">tech workers</a>); on the culture of privilige it creates; and on the education and employment gaps it continues to widen.<br>
      Tech is here to create smart ways to solve problems. And I love that. Never in history have we had so much access to knowledge, and we owe that to the tech industry. However, there is a plethora of social problems we are not trying to address with tech because the problems are not familiar to many working in the tech industry. <br>If you've never experience real hunger, you might not be thinking about using technology to find and easier way to distribute food in poor neighborhoods. <br> If you didn't attend an underfunded public school, you're probably not concerned with using tech to reform the public education system so that quality education is accessible to all. <br> Having a diverse workforce is important because each person applies their experiences to solving problems. Rich white men will focus on solving problems rich white men deal with. I am not trying to say that their problems are not real. I am simply saying it would be nice if we could use all our modern day tech advances to solve a wider scope of problems. If we have a tech workforce that more silimarly reflects the demographics of the American population at large, maybe we can start using tech to address more issues facing the American population at large.
