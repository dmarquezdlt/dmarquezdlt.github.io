        <h4>Coursera: Education for Everyone</h4>
        Coursera is a platform for online learning. I love it most for its purpose, but I also like its visually appeal, (reminds me of StartX), and ease of navigation.You are immediately drawn to the search function, so even before signing up, you can explore what kind of classes and institutions you can learn from. The second most striking thing are the classes right under it. So, if you don't know what you want to learn, it offers suggestions. The website is modern, organized, intuitive, minimalist (when it comes to text), and, well, pretty. There is lots of free content on the web, but this website gives free access to content from the best education institutions and it is extremely well organized. Once, you sign up, the functiality and organizeation gets even more impressive. The content is high-quality, education, easily-accessible, sharable, and mobile. The navigtion bar sits at the top and remains the there through your navigation through the site. You can always click on the logo to go back to the Home page. Browsing is easy. Of course you have to sign up and login to see all the content, but after you do there's the navigation bar and a dashboard to browse your classes/assignments, explore new courses. Added bonus: It's as easy to navigate this site on your phone/tablet through their app. Going through their site makes me feel inspired to learn more and excited that this content is available for free! I love "wasting" time on coursera, even if I don't actually take a course. It doesn't technically sell anything, (all content is free), but you can pay to get a certification after you finish the courses.

        <h4>Fab: Fab is Everyday Design</h4>
        I have a bad habit of shopping online. Fab is by far my favorite site to get lost in and find awesome shizz to buy. It focuses on displaying pictures of it's products. It uses plenty of white space, creating a great contrast for the colorful objects it sells.The first think you see is it's "Featured box" which scrolls through a few of thier most popular or newest collections. For example, today it has a feature on Art under $50, Back-to-School Gadgets, Saris from India,and some Houseweres from a new designer. The next thing you see is the side navigation bar where you can start browsing for products by categories. The website is simple, a little cluttered, modern,and appealing to the customer. If Amazon and Etsy merged, and they created a modern platform, it would be Fab.com. Its content is diverse, beautiful, and appealing. The navigation is a little confusing, because you have to go back to larger categories in order to go from one section to another. It's very easy to log on to buy towels and end up buying 10 things that you happened to stumble upon while looking for the towels. It's great spending time on there, but I always end up feeling like I just wasted too much time and money on useless stuff.

        <h4>GFDA: Good Fucking Design Advice</h4>
        My last website is a little different than the previous two. I just like this website because it gives good advice that looks pretty. I have their content as my desktop picture and screen saver because I love it so much.There's not much to this website: the first thing you see if their rotating advice pictures that are in 3 basic colors (black, white and orange) in huge Helvetica font. The rest of the page is white space, except for a navigation bar where you can buy prints or paraphanalia of their advice or pledge to follow the advice. It is elegant, beautiful, simple and in-you-face. The content is informational, educational, useful, applicable, and funny. It's easy to navigate because there's not much to do. After being on the site for a few minutes I feel pumped, inspired,and ready to get shit done.
