    <h3>Java Script </h3>
    <p>Have you heard of Javascript? I know I confused it with that other language (Java) that would pop up when I played online games in the late 90's, early 2000's.
     Javascript, however, was not the language responsible for my teenage fun. It is, instead, a dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with scripts.
    Initially, Javascript was the only language supported by both Netscape and IE, which gave rise to it's populrity as more and more people used these browsers. However, it stuck around after it's 90's success because it has proven to be excellent tool to build dynamic front-end websites. </p>
    <h3>The Good</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Loose Typing-</strong> What I mean by loose typing is that you don't need to follow overly-strict language structures to get your program to work. Javascript is kind of like Cool-Hippy-Uncle-That-Lets-You-Drink-With-Him of the programming language community. He's cool, no rules. Although loose typing can be daunting to people who are use to programming with more structured languages, Javascript's loose structure allows for more flexible programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Awesome UX-</strong> Thats' right. All those cool effects that you love to see on website, are more likely than not powered by Javascript. JS, (I can call it that because we're pretty close now), makes your page highly interactive and gives all your elements cool effects. Check out <a href="http://hellomonday.com/">HelloMonday.com</a> or <a href="http://sidigital.co/">SiDigital.co</a> if you want to see what kind of effects and User Experience I'm talking about.</li>
        <li><strong>Ubiquous-</strong> Javascript is supported by almost all browsers and devices. This is great because you don't have to worry about your cool new pop-up menu not working on new browsers or people's new tech gadgets. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Bad</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data-</strong> My biggest pet peeve it that for all the awesome things JS can do, it can't access data without the support of other tools. What a tool. </li>
        <li><strong>Security-</strong> Once you open a page on your browser, it runs the JS code, which might have some malicious intent, (such as a seperate pop up window asking you to send your personal info to claim your new iPad.) It is hard to prevent this type of security issues. </li>
    </ul>
