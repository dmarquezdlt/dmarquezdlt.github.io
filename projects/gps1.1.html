                <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
                <p>Pair programming is important for a few reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It prepares you for the marketplace/realworld. You will have to collaborate with other programmers in work, and practicing this process in DBC makes you better at it!</li>
                    <li>Develops interpersonal and teamwork skills. You have to communicate ideas and explain concepts to another person while working for a common goal, making you a more collaborative person.</li>
                    <li>Create more complete solutions. Two brains working on one problem is better than one.</li>
                </ol>
